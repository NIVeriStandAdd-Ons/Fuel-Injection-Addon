<h1>Stage Analysis Results</h1>
<p>This section contains the analysis results for a given stage within an shot. Note: not all channels will be present based on your selected settings.</p>
<h3>Event Analysis Channels</h3>
<p><strong>Pull In Time</strong>: The time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Pull In section to the start of the Hold section.
<p><strong>Pull In Max Current</strong>: The maximum current in amps (A) found during the Pull In section.
<p><strong>Pull In Max Voltage</strong>: The maximum voltage in volts (V) found during the Pull In section.
<p><strong>Pull In Min Voltage</strong>: The minimum voltage in volts (V) found during the Pull In section.
<p><strong>Pull In Avg Voltage</strong>: The average voltage in volts (V) found during the Pull In section.
<p><strong>Hold Time</strong>: The time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Hold section to the start of the Off section.
<p><strong>Hold Max Current</strong>: The maximum current in amps (A) found during the Hold section.
<p><strong>Hold Min Current</strong>: The minimum current in amps (A) found during the Hold section.
<p><strong>Hold Avg Current</strong>: The average current in amps (A) found during the Hold section.
<p><strong>Hold Max Voltage</strong>: The maximum voltage in volts (V) found during the Hold section.
<p><strong>Hold Min Voltage</strong>: The minimum voltage in volts (V) found during the Hold section.
<p><strong>Hold Avg Max Voltage</strong>: The peaks of the voltage signal are found during the Hold section. The maximum value of each peak is then taken and averaged in voltage (V).
<p><strong>Hold Avg Min Voltage</strong>: The valleys of the voltage signal are found during the Hold section. The minimum value of each valley is then taken and averaged in voltage (V).
<p><strong>Off Time</strong>: The time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Off section to the end of the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Max Current</strong>: The maximum current in amps (A) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Min Current</strong>: The minimum current in amps (A) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Avg Current</strong>: The average current in amps (A) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Max Voltage</strong>: The maximum voltage in volts (V) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Min Voltage</strong>: The minimum voltage in volts (V) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Avg Voltage</strong>: The average voltage in volts (V) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Total Voltage Pulses</strong>: The number of voltage pulses found during the entire stage (includes all three sections).
<p><strong>Total Stage Time</strong>: The total time of the stage (us).
