<h1>Stage Analysis Results</h1>
<p>This section contains the analysis results for a given stage within an injection shot. Note: not all channels will be present based on your selected settings.</p>
<h3>Injection Event Analysis Channels</h3>
<p><strong>Pull In Time</strong>: The time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Pull In section to the start of the Hold In section.
<p><strong>Pull In Max Current</strong>: The maximum current in amps (A) found during the Pull In section.
<p><strong>Hold In Time</strong>: The time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Hold In section to the start of the Off section.
<p><strong>Hold In Max Current</strong>: The maximum current in amps (A) found during the Hold In section.
<p><strong>Hold In Min Current</strong>: The minimum current in amps (A) found during the Hold In section.
<p><strong>Hold In Avg Current</strong>: The average current in amps (A) found during the Hold In section.
<p><strong>Hold In Avg Max Current</strong>: The peaks of the current signal are found during the Hold In section. The maximum value of each peak is then taken and averaged in amps (A).
<p><strong>Hold In Avg Min Current</strong>: The valleys of the current signal are found during the Hold In section. The minimum value of each valley is then taken and averaged in amps (A).
<p><strong>Hold In Max Voltage</strong>: The maximum voltage in volts (V) found during the Hold In section.
<p><strong>Hold In Min Voltage</strong>: The minimum voltage in volts (V) found during the Hold In section.
<p><strong>Hold In Avg Voltage</strong>: The average voltage in volts (V) found during the Hold In section.
<p><strong>Hold In Avg Max Voltage</strong>: The peaks of the voltage signal are found during the Hold In section. The maximum value of each peak is then taken and averaged in voltage (V).
<p><strong>Hold In Avg Min Voltage</strong>: The valleys of the voltage signal are found during the Hold In section. The minimum value of each valley is then taken and averaged in voltage (V).
<p><strong>Off Time</strong>: The time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Off section to the end of the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Stage Max Current</strong>: The maximum current in amps (A) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Stage Min Current</strong>: The minimum current in amps (A) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Stage Avg Current</strong>: The average current in amps (A) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Total Voltage Pulses</strong>: The number of voltage pulses found during the entire stage (includes all three sections).
