<h1>Stage Analysis Settings</h1>
<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>
<h3>Select Stage Analysis Channels</h3>
<p>The addon provides a varity of analysis per stage.  Each stage is broken up into 3 sections.  
<ul>
<li><strong>Pull In</strong>: This section is the beginning of a stage and is typically characterized by a increase in the current.
<li><strong>Hold</strong>: This section follows <strong>Pull In</strong> and is typically characterized by holding the current steady.
<li><strong>Off</strong>: The section is the end of the stage and is typically characterized by a decrease in current.
</ul>
<p>Not all stages have all three sections.  It depends on the control scheme used.  Because of this, each stage has analysis options that can be selected or removed.  To get the results of the analysis, select the channel from the <strong>Analysis</strong> list then select <strong>Apply</strong>.  The analysis types are:
<p></p>
<p><strong>Pull In Time</strong>: The time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Pull In section to the start of the Hold section.
<p><strong>Pull In Max Current</strong>: The maximum current in amps (A) found during the Pull In section.
<p><strong>Pull In Max Voltage</strong>: The maximum voltage in volts (V) found during the Pull In section.
<p><strong>Pull In Min Voltage</strong>: The minimum voltage in volts (V) found during the Pull In section.
<p><strong>Pull In Avg Voltage</strong>: The average voltage in volts (V) found during the Pull In section.
<p><strong>Hold Time</strong>: The time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Hold section to the start of the Off section.
<p><strong>Hold Max Current</strong>: The maximum current in amps (A) found during the Hold section.
<p><strong>Hold Min Current</strong>: The minimum current in amps (A) found during the Hold section.
<p><strong>Hold Avg Current</strong>: The average current in amps (A) found during the Hold section.
<p><strong>Hold Max Voltage</strong>: The maximum voltage in volts (V) found during the Hold section.
<p><strong>Hold Min Voltage</strong>: The minimum voltage in volts (V) found during the Hold section.
<p><strong>Hold Avg Max Voltage</strong>: The peaks of the voltage signal are found during the Hold section. The maximum value of each peak is then taken and averaged in voltage (V).
<p><strong>Hold Avg Min Voltage</strong>: The valleys of the voltage signal are found during the Hold section. The minimum value of each valley is then taken and averaged in voltage (V).
<p><strong>Off Time</strong>: The time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Off section to the end of the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Max Current</strong>: The maximum current in amps (A) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Min Current</strong>: The minimum current in amps (A) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Avg Current</strong>: The average current in amps (A) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Max Voltage</strong>: The maximum voltage in volts (V) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Min Voltage</strong>: The minimum voltage in volts (V) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Off Avg Voltage</strong>: The average voltage in volts (V) found during the Off section.
<p><strong>Total Voltage Pulses</strong>: The number of voltage pulses found during the entire stage (includes all three sections).
<p><strong>Total Stage Time</strong>: The total time of the stage (us).
