<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>
<h3>Select Stage Analysis Channels</h3>
<p>The addon provides a varity of analysis per stage.  Each stage is broken up into 3 sections.  
<ul>
<li><strong>Pull In</strong>: This section is the beginning of a stage and is typically characterized by a increase in the current.
<li><strong>Hold In</strong>: This section follows <strong>Pull In</strong> and is typically characterized by holding the current steady.
<li><strong>Off</strong>: The section is the end of the stage and is typically characterized by a decrease in current.
</ul>
<p>Not all stages have all three sections.  It depends on the injection scheme used.  Because of this, each stage has analysis options that can be selected or removed.  To get the results of the analysis, select the channel from the <strong>Analysis</strong> list then select <strong>Apply</strong>.  The analysis types are:
<ul>
<li><strong>Pull In Time</strong>: This is the time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Pull In section to the start of the Hold In section.
<li><strong>Pull In Max Current</strong>:   This is the Max Current in Amps (A) found during the Pull In section.
<li><strong>Hold In Time</strong>: This is the time in microseconds (us) from the start of the Hold In section to the start of the Off section.
<li><strong>Hold In Max Current</strong>: This is the maximum current in Amps (A)
<li><strong>Hold In Min Current</strong>: 
<li><strong>Hold In Avg Current</strong>: 
<li><strong>Hold In Avg Max Current</strong>: 
<li><strong>Hold In Avg Min Current</strong>: 
<li><strong>Hold In Max Voltage</strong>: 
<li><strong>Hold In Min Voltage</strong>: 
<li><strong>Hold In Avg Voltage</strong>: 
<li><strong>Hold In Avg Max Voltage</strong>: 
<li><strong>Hold In Avg Min Voltage</strong>: 
<li><strong>Off Time</strong>: 
<li><strong>Off Stage Max Current</strong>: 
<li><strong>Off Stage Min Current</strong>: 
<li><strong>Off Stage Avg Current</strong>: 
<li><strong>Total Voltage Pulses</strong>: 
</ul>
